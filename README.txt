To get started, run the program, it will then create config.json and macro.json.

Next up, open config.json and config it to your liking, make sure to fill in at least one token, if you don't know how to get your token, go to: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token

You can then boot up the program without any further issues.

USER_TOKENS: Can fill in multiple, seperate "string" values, divided by comma.
SAFE_MODE: Will disable embedding and make a few other changes to MASSIVELY decrease chance of getting detected.
PREFIX: This will be the prefix you use. (default dep.)
INVITE: Linked to the [PREFIX]invite command, (default Depresso Development server)
