This SelfBot for discord was written by myself due to myself and a few friends all suddenly getting a surge of inspiration to use SelfBots. Despite being against TOS, they were fun to toy around with and see what you can do with it.

My selfbot ended up seeing a lot of use, having ~60 users at its prime. Below was the simple guide I wrote for users to use to set up the bot.

Depresso Selfbot

Thanks for using Depresso Selfbot!!

Support discord: [NO LONGER SUPPORTED]

To get started, run the program, it will then create config.json and macro.json.

Next up, open config.json and config it to your liking, make sure to fill in at least one token, if you don't know how to get your token, go to: https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token

You can then boot up the program without any further issues.

USER_TOKENS: Can fill in multiple, seperate "string" values, divided by comma.
SAFE_MODE: Will disable embedding and make a few other changes to MASSIVELY decrease chance of getting detected.
PREFIX: This will be the prefix you use. (default dep.)
INVITE: Linked to the [PREFIX]invite command, (default Depresso Development server)


macro.json;

You can add in as many macros as you'd like, just make sure to stick to the format provided, if you want to add more, you can copy paste this under the current macros. Just keep in mind that any minor mistake in the format can and will break the macro command.
